I am a student at Johns Hopkins University studying Computer Science and Economics. My interests are in finance and technology. My financial interests include stocks, mergers and acquisitions, banking, corporate finance, and regulations. My technological interests include software development, computers, data structures, compilers, programming languages, and machine learning. My colleagues would describe me as a driven and persistent individual who maintains an optimistic mindset. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to develop and apply my knowledge of the technology and finance.

Please take a look at my Portfolio or CV.
