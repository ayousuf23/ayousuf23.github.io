Hello! I am a student at Johns Hopkins University studying Computer Science and Economics. My technological interests include software development, computers, data structures, compilers, programming languages, and machine learning. My colleagues would describe me as a driven and persistent individual who maintains an optimistic mindset. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to develop and apply my knowledge of technology.

Please take a look at my Portfolio or CV.
