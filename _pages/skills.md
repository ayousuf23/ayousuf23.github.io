These are the programming langauges I know and/or have experience with:
- C#
- C++
- C
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

I have limited experience working with Swift.

I have experience working with many frameworks and libraries. Most of my experience is in the .NET realm. I have been using .NET since 2016/2017. For university, I mostly use C, C++, or Java. I am a quick learner, and I can find out anything I need to know from documentation, StackOverflow, or GitHub.
