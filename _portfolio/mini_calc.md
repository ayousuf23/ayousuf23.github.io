Mini Caclulator Interpreter is a program that interprets mathematical expressions. It supports parentheses, nested parentheses, user-defined variables, addition, substraction, multiplication, divison, and exponents. The program has three components: a lexer (which analyzes input and turns it into tokens), a parser (which turns the tokens into a parse tree), and an interpreter (which interprets the parse tree and returns the result of the mathemetical expression). I wrote the program in C and C++. 

To invoke the program, run the minicalc executable--it will read the input from standard input. You can also specify a file to read from by inkoving the program as `./minicalc [optional filename]` You can also print the tree representation of the input by invoking the program as `./minicalc -p [optional filename]`

Examples:

Input: `1+1;` 
Output: `Result: 2`

Input: 
`c = (a = 1) + (b = 2);
d = c + a * b;
d;` 
Output: `Result: 5`

Example tree generated by the input `2 ^ ((1+2) * 3);`:

Note that every expression must be terminated by a semicolon and only the result of the final expression is returned. Also, the root node is called 'S' (S for Start).
