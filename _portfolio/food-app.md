During February-May 2021, my team and I worked on a large web application called "Chicken Tinder", which is a website designed to help people choose where to eat. 
You can use the app to find restaurants by yourself or in a group. The websites shows a range of restaurants. If everyone in the group likes one of these restaurants, a match is found. Otherwise, when everyone in the group is 
done looking at the restaurants, a recommendation is shown. The group can continue and more restaurants will be shown, or they can stop searching.

The website uses the user's location in order to find nearby restaurants. The user can also permanently save his/her location. 
Users can also apply filters when searching for restaurants. For example, they choose specific cuisines,
price ranges, and options such as kosher, vegan, or vegetarian. 

The website comprises a frontend, and a backend with a database. The backend server is responsible for obtaining restaurant data, filtering restaurant data, user registration, user login, and hosting groups. 
For the backend, we used Sparkjava and Socket.io. For the frontend, we used React.

My team and I used Agile methodology while working on our app. We planned the project by looking at must-have features and nice-to-haves and creating a roadmap that
broke down our timeframe into two-week iterations. For each iteration, we completed the planned user stories or bug fixes.

This was my first time working on a large team project, and I have definitely learned a lot from this experience. As a result, I am more capable in planning software projcts as well as developing applications.
