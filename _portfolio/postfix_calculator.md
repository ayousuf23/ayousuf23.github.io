 A postfix calculator is a type of calculator that evaluates postfix expressions. An expression like `1+2` where the operator is between the operands is called an infix expression. On the other hand, when the operator comes after the operands, it is called a postfix expression. 
 
 The Postfix Calculator project actually includes two postfix calculators: one written in C, and the other is written in x86-64 Assembly. Yes, that's right--it is written in **Assembly**, which is a difficult language to program in. Generally, program langauges provide many abstractions that are not available in Assembly. For example, programming languages provide the notion of infinite possible variables while in Assembly there are a limited number of registers and using the stack as storage can be tricky. The reason why Assembly is used is because it represents actual machine instructions. If you want to know how a computer works, program Assembly.
