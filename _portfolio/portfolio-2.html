I created an interpreter for mathematical expressions. It supports parentheses, nested parentheses, user-defined variables, addition, substraction, multiplication, divison, and exponents. 
The program has three components: a lexer, a parser, and an interpreter. I wrote these components by myself in C and C++. It can even print expressions in a tree format (which is helpful for learning how it works).
