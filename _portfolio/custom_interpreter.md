I created my own programming language. The language is interpreted and supports if, if/else, while statements, user-declared functions, variables, different return types, and mathematical operations. Functions have their own scopes and scopes can be nested. I wrote the langauge in C and C++ using Flex as the lexical analyzer and Bison as the parser, and it took me nearly a month to complete. The interpreter uses an abstract syntax tree (AST) as the final representation. The program turns input into lexical tokens, parses them into the AST, interprets the tree, and prints the result.

To run the program, call the program and pass a filename (the input). Optionally, you can put "-p" before the filename to print the AST generated.

Example calling the program on Linux:
`echo "var a, b; a = 1; b=3; function myFunction(x, y) { x+y;} myFunction(a, b);" | ./inte
rp /dev/stdin`

Output:
`Result: 4`

Here is an example for printing the AST generated:
Call: `echo "var a, b; a = 1; b=3; function myFunction(x, y) { x+y;} myFunction(a, b);" | ./inte
rp -p /dev/stdin`

Output:
