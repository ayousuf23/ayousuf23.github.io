MinesweeperX is a video game based off the classic Minesweeper. MinesweeperX is a reimagination of Minesweeper with an improved UI, multiple resolution support, music, sound effects, touch screen support, and saved settings.

I created MinesweeperX using C#, .NET Core, MonoGame, and Geonbit.UI. Actually, this is not the first time I made a Minesweeper game--I've written multiple versions of Minesweeper in the past. In April 2020, I decided to rewrite Minesweeper from scratch and publish it on Steam and Google Play. When I had previously written Minesweeper in the past, there were some flaws or missing features. However, this is a complete Minesweeper experience written using new techniques I had learned in my university coursework.

The game plays like a Minesweeper game. There is a timer, a flag, and a grid of cells waiting to be uncovered. You can buy the game on Steam or Google Play. Please click the image at the top with the text "Avalible on Steam" to visit the game's Steam page.
